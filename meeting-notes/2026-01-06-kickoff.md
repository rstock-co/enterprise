# Kickoff Meeting — January 6, 2026

**Attendees:** Richard Stock, JP Boodhoo, Matt Kennedy

---

## Key Themes

JP led the meeting. Primary emphasis: **THROUGHPUT**

- Throughput over quality — iterate fast, ship fast
- 2026 = foundation year (pour the foundation, learn what works)
- 2027 = money maker year (capitalize on 2026 learnings)

---

## Goals

- **24 products in 2026** — 2 per month, 1 every 2 weeks
- **90-day goal: $3,000 MRR per person** ($9,000 total)
- First taste of real money from internet strangers = strongest motivator

---

## Strategy: Build First, Market Later

**Alex Hormozi principle:** Be the product first.

- Bodybuilder analogy: Build the body before marketing it
- For us: Build the apps/portfolio first, not the audience
- Marketing for now = personal blogging about what we're building
- Build a history of successful products
- Portfolio website showcasing the three co-founders
- When people research us in late 2026/2027, they find a track record of excellence

---

## Methodology: Shape Up

- Reference: Shape Up book (Basecamp)
- Turn into Claude Code primitives
- **2-week delivery cycles** — build, monetize, ship every 2 weeks max
- Cycles compress as we improve

---

## Tooling Decisions

### Slack (Nucleus)
- Primary communication hub
- Automated bots and integrations
- JP proficient at building Slack integrations
- TODO: Research paid vs free tier

### GitHub Organization
- All three individuals added
- **Monorepo called "Core"** (this repo renamed)
- JP's preference: one repo, not multi-repo
- Contains: Claude Code tooling, vision docs, all systems

### Claude Code (Automation Layer)
- All three have Claude Code installed
- AI agent manages tasks from each person's machine
- Fully automated task delegation

---

## Systems to Build

### Task System (GitHub Issues)
- GitHub Issues = task system (not tasks.md files)
- Slash commands to interact with issues
- Issue description = **completion criteria only** (WHAT, not HOW)
- No implementation details — Claude/AI figures out the HOW
- Any co-founder can see/claim tasks others created
- Claude automatically manages completion

### Proposal System
- Formalized proposal delivery system
- Slash commands:
  - `/proposal-draft` — create new proposal
  - `/proposal-read` — view a proposal
  - `/proposal-search` — search proposals
  - `/proposal-list` — list all proposals
- Anyone can contribute proposals
- AI ranks proposals by:
  - Chance of success / MRR potential
  - What's hot in the market
  - Viability analysis
- **MRR is the ONLY objective**

---

## Automated Tracking

- Claude Code tracks MRR performance per product
- Course corrects automatically
- Surfaces what's actually making money
- Prioritization: What makes money > what we want to do

---

## Next Steps

1. Set up Slack workspace
2. Create GitHub organization
3. Rename this repo to "Core"
4. Build proposal system slash commands
5. Build task system (GitHub Issues integration)
6. Research Shape Up book → Claude Code primitives
