## Canadian Domain Strategy: .ca When .com is Taken

Since we're a Canadian company, here's guidance on whether grabbing a .ca domain makes sense when .com/.ai are already taken.

### When .ca is Safe (Low Risk)

- The .com is **parked/unused** with no active business behind it
- The name is **generic/descriptive** (e.g., "buildtools.com" — generic terms are hard to trademark)
- **No trademark registered** in Canada or internationally for that name
- The .com owner operates in a **completely different industry** (e.g., they sell furniture, we sell software)

---

### When .ca is Risky (Avoid)

- The .com owner has a **registered trademark** (especially in Canada, US, or internationally via WIPO)
- They're **actively operating a business**, especially in tech/software
- The name is **distinctive/coined** (easier to enforce trademark protection)
- They're a **well-funded company** that will enforce their IP rights
- Example: liftoff.com is owned by Herbalife — avoid entirely

### Key Principle: Trademarks Matter, Not Domains

Domain ownership alone doesn't give legal protection. **Trademarks do.**

Someone can own example.com, but if they never trademarked "Example" and don't operate a business under that name, they have weak legal standing to challenge your .ca registration.

### Before Registering Any .ca Domain

1. **Search Canadian Trademarks Database**: https://ised-isde.canada.ca/cipo/trademark-search
2. **Search USPTO** (US trademarks matter for cross-border): https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks
3. **Google the name** — check if there's an active business using it
4. **Check the .com** — is it parked, for sale, or an active company?

### Practical Recommendations

| Scenario | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| .com owned by major corporation | High | Avoid entirely |
| .com is active tech/software business | High | Avoid — too much confusion |
| .com is parked/for sale, no trademark | Medium | Proceed with caution |
| .com is different industry, no trademark | Low | Likely safe |
| Name is generic/descriptive | Low | Harder to enforce against you |

### Safest Path Forward

Pick a **unique/coined name** where we can secure the .com ourselves. This avoids:
- Trademark disputes
- Brand confusion
- Cease & desist letters
- CDRP challenges (CIRA's domain dispute process)

If serious about a name where .com is taken, budget ~$300-500 CAD for a **Canadian IP lawyer** to provide a quick opinion on risk level.
