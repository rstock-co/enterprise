# Roadmap

## The Big Picture

| Year | Focus | Goal |
|------|-------|------|
| **2026** | Foundation | Pour the foundation, ship 24 products, learn what works |
| **2027** | Monetization | Capitalize on 2026 learnings, scale what makes money |

---

## 2026 Goals

- **24 products shipped** — 2 per month, 1 every 2 weeks
- **90-day milestone: $9,000 MRR** ($3,000 per person)
- First real money from internet strangers
- Build portfolio and track record of excellence

---

## The Vibe: Throughput Over Quality

**We iterate in days, not weeks.**

- **Pump out ideas fast** — AI generates, we test
- **Fail fast, learn fast** — Kill what doesn't work in days
- **Good enough beats perfect** — Ship ugly MVPs, get real feedback
- **Volume over polish** — Test 10 rough ideas rather than perfect 1
- **MRR is the ONLY metric** — Everything equates to monthly recurring revenue

---

## Methodology: Shape Up (2-Week Cycles)

Based on the Shape Up book (Basecamp):

- **2-week delivery cycles** — build, monetize, ship
- Full product shipped every 2 weeks max
- Cycles compress as we improve
- No endless projects — everything has a 2-week cap

---

## Strategy: Build First, Market Later

**Alex Hormozi principle:** Be the product first.

- Build the apps/portfolio first, not the audience
- Marketing for now = personal blogging about what we're building
- Document the journey, build a history of shipped products
- Portfolio website showcasing the three co-founders
- When people research us (late 2026/2027), they find excellence
