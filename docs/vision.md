# Enterprise Vision

## Core Thesis

With the release of Opus 4.5 and the Claude Code agent framework, AI can now outperform human research, ideation, and even coding speed — including developers at JP's elite level. Rather than compete with this reality, we embrace it.

**Our role is not to be the brains. Our role is to be skilled operators.**

---

## The Shift

Traditional software teams ask: *"What should we build?"*

We ask: *"How do we become the best operators of the thing that can figure out what to build?"*

This isn't AI as a tool we use occasionally. This is AI as an extension of our thinking — something we direct, coordinate, and unleash at scale.

---

## The Strategy

### Phase 1: Build the Harness

JP has developed **The Forge** — a multi-agent orchestration system on top of Claude Code. This harness allows us to:

- Coordinate multiple AI agents working in parallel
- Manage complex, multi-step workflows
- Maintain context and state across agent sessions
- Scale execution beyond what a single operator could manage

Think of it as infrastructure that lets us deploy AI at scale rather than one conversation at a time.

### Phase 2: AI-Driven Research

Once the harness is ready, we use it to have AI research and identify:

- The most viable paths to monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Market opportunities we wouldn't have found ourselves
- Business models suited to our team's specific strengths
- Competitive landscapes and positioning strategies

We don't come in with preconceived product ideas. We let AI analyze the landscape and tell us where the opportunities are.

### Phase 3: Execute on AI's Vision

- AI defines the product/service strategy
- We use our operator skills to execute at speed
- We iterate rapidly based on AI-driven feedback loops
- If something isn't working, AI helps us pivot quickly

## Why This Works

| Traditional Approach | Our Approach |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Humans ideate, AI assists | AI ideates, humans operate |
| Limited by human research bandwidth | AI can research 24/7 |
| Ego-driven product decisions | Data-driven, AI-validated decisions |
| Slow iteration cycles | Rapid AI-guided pivots |

**The competitive advantage isn't having better ideas.** It's having the infrastructure and skill to let AI generate ideas and then execute on them faster than anyone else.

## Team Roles

**Richard Stock — Co-Founder**
- Operational leadership and execution discipline
- Business administration and stakeholder management

**JP Boodhoo — Co-Founder**
- Creator of **The Forge** — our multi-agent orchestration harness
- Elite Claude Code operator ($3K+/month in credits, top performer at his company)
- Quality assurance on AI-generated code and architecture
- Decades of pattern recognition to validate AI recommendations

**Matt Kennedy — Co-Founder**
- Fresh perspective on AI-native workflows
- Rapid skill development in agent orchestration
- Execution capacity as skills develop

---

## The Goal

**Secure monthly recurring revenue for all team members.**

We don't predetermine what that looks like. We trust the process:

1. Build the harness
2. Let AI research the opportunities
3. Execute on what AI recommends
4. Iterate until MRR is achieved

---

## What We Bring to the Table

We're not competing on ideas. We're competing on:

- **Operator skill** — Ability to effectively direct and coordinate AI agents
- **Execution speed** — Translating AI output into deployed products/services
- **Quality judgment** — Knowing when AI output is production-ready vs. needs refinement
- **Trust and collaboration** — A team that works well together and can move fast

---

## The Bet

We're betting that in 2026 and beyond, the winners won't be the smartest humans in the room. The winners will be the humans who know how to operate AI most effectively.

We have:
- An elite developer who built The Forge and operates Claude Code at scale (JP)
- An experienced operator with leadership and execution discipline (Richard)
- A high-potential operator ready to grow into the role (Matt)

The three of us, working together, operating AI as a unified team — that's the enterprise.
