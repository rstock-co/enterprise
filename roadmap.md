# 90-Day Roadmap

**Goal:** $6,000 MRR ($2,000 per person)
**Timeline:** 90 days from kickoff
**Start Date:** [Today's meeting]

---

## The Vibe: Speed Over Perfection

**We iterate in days, not weeks.**

This isn't a waterfall plan where we spend months planning before we ship. This is rapid experimentation:

- **Pump out ideas fast** — AI generates, we test
- **Fail fast, learn fast** — Kill what doesn't work in days, not months
- **Good enough beats perfect** — Ship ugly MVPs, get real feedback
- **Volume over polish** — We'd rather test 10 rough ideas than perfect 1

The goal is to find what works through rapid iteration, not through endless planning.

---

## The Approach

We're not going to sit in a room and brainstorm product ideas. We're going to:
1. Use AI to research viable paths to MRR
2. Test ideas in DAYS, not weeks
3. Kill losers fast, double down on winners
4. Iterate relentlessly based on real market feedback
